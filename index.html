    <p>Yesterday went very well. I woke up and drove to my brothers baseball tryouts after getting dutch. We then left on our way here and my mom spilt her coffee all over my car so we stopped in Marysville, CA for starbucks so she could get another coffee. When we got to Chico we toured my dorm for the Fall and went to Madison Bear Garden for lunch. Then we headed to check into this camp.<p>
